# List Operations in Python

This Python program demonstrates various operations on a list called `my_list`. The operations include appending elements, inserting values, extending the list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

## Program Overview

The program performs the following steps:

1. **Create an Empty List**: 
   - An empty list named `my_list` is initialized.

2. **Append Elements**: 
   - The values `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` are added to `my_list` using the `append()` method.

3. **Insert an Element**: 
   - The value `15` is inserted at the second position (index `1`) in the list using the `insert()` method.

4. **Extend the List**: 
   - The list is extended with another list `[50, 60, 70]` using the `extend()` method.

5. **Remove the Last Element**: 
   - The last element of `my_list` is removed using the `pop()` method.

6. **Sort the List**: 
   - The list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.

7. **Find the Index of a Value**: 
   - The index of the value `30` is found using the `index()` method and printed to the console.

## Final Output

After executing the program, the final state of `my_list` and the index of the value `30` will be displayed.
